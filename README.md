javadoc2ceylondoc
=================

A small Ceylon tool to convert javadoc to ceylondoc in certain scenarios.

Usage
-----

At the moment, this tool can only convert single-line comments without any formatting. Additionally, the resulting ceylon doc always starts right at the beginning of the line and isnâ€™t indented (which is syntactically correct, but ugly).
